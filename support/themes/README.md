# Blockfish themes

## Selecting a theme

Blockfish reads `./config/theme.json` to to choose theme, so you can choose one of these
themes by replacing `theme.json` with the desired theme `.json` file.

If `theme.json` is missing, it will default to the `jstris.json` theme.

## Creating a theme

Themes are specified in JSON format with 24-bit hex colors (`#RRGGBB`). Warning: Blockfish
will not successfully launch if the theme file is specified incorrectly.
